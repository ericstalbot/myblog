Why Another Web Map?

I recently launched my new web map at http://ericstalbot.pythonanywhere.com/. 
I'm pretty excited about it, but why do we need another web map
when the internet already has so many very good ones?

I started working on the map back when I lived in Vermont, and
it's original purpose was very simple: to help me plan 
bike rides on the Green Mountain State's beautiful back roads. 
I had tried to use the internet's existing maps, but they didn't 
work for me. So I decided to build my own map with a number 
of improvements:

- My new map shows trails and class 4 roads, which are unmaintained
  public right-of-way. They are usually unpassable to most vehicles
  but they are fun to ride and provide important connections between
  valleys. 
- You can zoom way out on my map, and the smaller, less important 
  roads never disappear. So you can zoom out far enough to plan 
  a longer ride, but still see all the tiny dirt roads that you 
  can piece together to make your ride fun. 
- The map does not have distracting features like hill shading. 
  The focus is on the roads, which makes it easy to 
  see how roads connect to each other and make 
  infinite possibilities for out-and-back and looping rides.
- The router on the map has no concept of "best", or "fastest"
  path, so it does not force the path to follow the big 
  roads, which often have too much traffic. Instead, it 
  simply follows the least-distance path, which can produce 
  some fun rides and help you see possible paths that you've never
  considered. 
  
Go ahead and try the map out. In the meantime, I'll be working 
on making it even better.
